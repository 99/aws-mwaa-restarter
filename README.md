## üöÄ Introduction

`mwaa-restarter` is a command-line utility that provides a streamlined approach to list and selectively update environments in Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA).

## üìã Requirements

- Rust
- AWS SDK for Rust
- AWS CLI (configured with the necessary credentials)
